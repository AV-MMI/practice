				<th class="text-al" scope="row">Maryam Mirzakhani</td>
				<td class="num-al">1977 - 2017</td>
				<td class="text-al">Iranian-born Maryam Mirzakhani was one of the greatest mathematicians of her generation, making exceptional contributions to the study of the dynamics and geometry of mathematical objects called Riemann surfaces.</td>
				<td class="text-al">Her work had a huge impact in shaping her field and has opened up new frontiers of research that are just starting to be explored. She shows us that, even in a male-dominated field, women can be role models and lead the way forward with their discoveries.</td>

				<th class="text-al" scope="row">Katherine Johnson</th>
				<td class="num-al">1918 – 2020</td>
				<td class="text-al">Falling in love with maths from a young age, Katherine studied the subject alongside French at university, graduating summa cum laude at the age of just 18! She joined NASA in 1953 and her contributions in orbital mechanics were crucial to the success of the USA’s aeronautics and space programmes. In 2015, she was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama for her important work as a mathematician, physicist and space scientist as a woman of colour.</td>
				<td class="text-al">Despite being one of the first three black women to attend West Virginia University, she dared to challenge the stereotypes which existed around her and has since become a pioneering example and role model for females everywhere of African American women in STEM.</td>

			<tr>
				<th class="text-al" scope="row">Mary Cartwright</th>
				<td class="num-al">1900 - 1998</td>
				<td class="text-al">Mary Cartwright was a British mathematician and a woman of many firsts! She was not only the first woman to obtain a first in her university degree, but also one of the first mathematicians to study what is now known as chaos theory. She was the first woman to receive the Sylvester Medal (awarded for the encouragement of mathematical research), the first woman to be President of the Mathematical Association and the first woman to be President of the London Mathematical Society.</td>
				<td class="text-al">Thanks to her bravery in daring to defy the status quo, her work has gone on to strongly influence the modern theory of dynamical systems, and she even has a mathematical theorem named after her!</td>

				<th class="text-al" scope="row">Sofia Kovalevskaya</th>
				<td class="num-al">1850 – 1891</td>
				<td class="text-al">Russian mathematician Sofia Kovalevskaya made monumental contributions to analysis, partial differential equations and mechanics. She was a pioneer and icon for females in mathematics and STEM subjects everywhere.</td>
				<td class="text-al">Despite scrutiny and doubts from her male counterparts and society as a whole, Sofia refused to give up academia and has paved the way for other famous females mathematicians to follow in her footsteps!</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th class="text-al" scope="row">Sophie Germain</th>
				<td class="num-al">1776 – 1831</td>
				<td class="text-al">Marie-Sophie Germain was a French mathematician and physicist who, despite opposition from society (and her parents) due to her sex, persevered and went on to greatly contribute to maths. Due to the unfair gender restraints at the time, she was not able to pursue a career in the subject, but that did not stop her!</td>
				<td class="text-al">She proved to the people around her that their assumptions based on her sex were wrong and that females are incredible mathematicians. Although she was not allowed to attend university, thanks to her unfaltering determination and bravery she became the very first woman to make important original contributions to mathematical research and in doing so, carved out the way for women today.</td>

			<tr>
				<th class="text-al" scope="row">Marjorie Lee Browne</th>
				<td class="num-al">1914 – 1979</td>
				<td class="text-al">Gifted African-American mathematician and educator Marjorie Lee Browne was the first black woman to gain a doctorate in maths. She joined the faculty at North Carolina Central University, shortly after obtaining her Ph.D, where she taught for over thirty years. She was named chair of the Mathematics Department there in 1951, which allowed her to guide the way for some of the earliest computer use in her field.</td>
				<td class="text-al">She noted that the lack of involvement of black women in STEM subjects was a huge societal issue that needed to be addressed and believed that education was a viable solution. She took advantage of her position as department chair at NCCU to gain a grant to educate secondary school teachers in advanced maths and spent much of her time with local secondary school teachers teaching them about linear algebra, encouraging them to study and obtain advanced degrees and improving the level of maths education as a whole in North Carolina. Her dedication to inspiring confidence in female mathematicians and providing quality education to others for the greater good, has helped her to become a role model for women in STEM everywhere.</td>

				<th class="text-al" scope="row">Rachel Riley</th>
				<td class="num-al">1986 - present</td>
				<td class="text-al">Television presenter Rachel Riley studied Mathematics at Oxford University. At age 22 she joined Countdown where she applies her maths skills on a regular basis, handling the letters and numbers rounds to find solutions to complicated problems. She has gone on to present other shows including 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown and The Gadget Show, and even starred as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing!</td>
				<td class="text-al">Riley has visited many schools over the years in an endeavour to inspire children on the “joys of applied maths, quantum mechanics and time travel” and increase the numbers of females participating in STEM subjects. She has shown us that pursuing your passion and studying maths at university can lead to us down different avenues, including less conventional ones such as a career in television!</td>

				<th class="text-al" scope="row">Malala Yousafzai</th>
				<td class="num-al">1997 - present</td>
				<td class="text-al">Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist for female educational rights, and the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize, at just age 17! She started participating in activism when she was only 11 years of age and began writing blogs for the BBC detailing what life was like under Taliban rule and her beliefs on the important role education plays for girls across the world – and especially in Pakistan.

</td>
				<td class="text-al">Due to the nature of Malala’s work, an attempt was made on her life when she was on her way to school one morning. It was unsuccessful, and she refused to let this stop her fighting for her cause, continuing to give speeches and interviews for women’s educational rights. Her story drove the United Nations to launch a campaign for the education of all of children worldwide, which ultimately led to Pakistan’s first Right to Education Bill.</td>

				<th class="text-al" scope="row">Mayim Bialik</th>
				<td class="num-al">1975 - present</td>
				<td class="text-al">American actress Mayim Bialik studied neuroscience at UCLA, where she went on to obtain a Ph.D in 2007. She is best known for her role as Dr. Amy Fowler in the comedy The Big Bang Theory, but has starred in countless other television shows and films.</td>
				<td class="text-al">Despite success in her early acting career, Mayim still decided to study neuroscience at university because she had a passion for the subject. She believes strongly in the involvement of women in STEM subjects and has spoken at events on the topic encouraging girls to pursue these disciplines. She also plays the bass and trumpet! </td>
